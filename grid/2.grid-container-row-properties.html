    In Cascading Style Sheets, CSS grid layout or CSS grid creates complex responsive web design layouts more easily and
    consistently across browsers.[6] There have been other methods for controlling web page layout methods, such as
    tables, the box model, and CSS flex box. CSS grid is currently not an official standard (it is a W3C Candidate
    Recommendation) although it has been adopted by most major browsers.[2]
    CSS grid can create more asymmetrical layouts than the previous grid and layout options like CSS floats. It also
    allows for more standardized code that works across browsers. This is in contrast to relying on specific browser
    hacks or complicated workarounds.[2]
